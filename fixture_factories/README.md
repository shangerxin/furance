# Introduction
This is the folder for containing the development codes for the test fixture folder.
Each folder can be a sub web application to provide test cases for different web
development technologies such as angular, react etc.

Each sub app is independent to each other. The build out put should be copied to under
the Furance/furance/fixtures folder.

There are two examples for angularjs and react. We can provide different versions for
the same framework in the future.

The sub app could also be a linked git repository. It can be pointed to another git
repository if required.
